      <h1><small>Who are we?</small></h1>
	  <p>
	  Muscular Catholicism wants men within in our ranks to be spiritually and physically strong. 
	  We believe strengthening the mind, body, and spirit is conducive to the overall well being of man. 
	  We also believe it is important to exhibit strength rather than weakness 
	  in the face of enemies who are hostile to our way of life, values and Christian faith. <br>
      <br>As practitioners of Muscular Catholicism we promote the traditional Catholic faith absent of the modernist perversions, 
      we also promote the return of a masculine western attitude and values. We honor the spirit exhibited by our Crusader ancestors.<br>
      <br>We advocate for Muscular Catholic men to get into a routine of prayer and study combined with physical training.
      Our focus is strengthening and building the body of the Catholic man with weight/resistance training and sound nutrition. 
      Also we promote studying and actively training in various fighting styles that one day may be used to defend ourselves, faith, 
      or family from those who seek to do us harm.<br> 
      <br>Interests often discussed among Muscular Catholics are weightlifting, 
      bodybuilding, boxing, wrestling, martial arts (various forms), history, politics, nutrition, restoring and promoting masculinity.<br>
      We welcome other honorable men thirsting for a strong faith and physical discipline to adopt the ways of the Muscular Catholic.  
      In order to be in the Muscular Catholicism movement men must have a true interest in the study, 
      defense, and preservation of the Catholic faith.<br>
      <br>Men also must have a genuine interest in training their bodies and being students of the iron game or a martial art/fight style of their choice.  
      The Muscular Catholic must also fully reject the poisonous ideas and modernist forces seeking to destroy western and Christian tradition, 
      culture and values. Examples such as feminism, neo Babelism, new age, lgbtq movement, ect.
